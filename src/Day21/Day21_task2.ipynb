    "1. Supervised Learning\n",
    "   Supervised Learning is a type of machine learning where the data already has labels or correct answers.\n",
    "   The model learns from input-output examples and tries to predict the correct output for new data.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Unsupervised Learning\n",
    "   Unsupervised Learning is used when the data has no labels or answers.\n",
    "   The model tries to find hidden patterns, similarities, or clusters in the data by itself.  \n",
    "\n",
    "3. Reinforcement Learning\n",
    "   Reinforcement Learning is where a system learns by trial and error.\n",
    "   It receives rewards for correct actions and penalties for wrong actions, and improves over time.\n",
